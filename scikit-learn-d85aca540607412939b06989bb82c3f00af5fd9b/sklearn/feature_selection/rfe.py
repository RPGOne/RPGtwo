class RFE(BaseEstimator):
    """Feature ranking with recursive feature elimination.

    Given an external estimator that assigns weights to features (e.g., the
    coefficients of a linear model), the goal of recursive feature elimination
    (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller
    sets of features.  First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of
    features and weights are assigned to each one of them. Then, features whose
    absolute weights are the smallest are pruned from the current set features.
    That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired
    number of features to select is eventually reached.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        A supervised learning estimator with a `fit` method that updates a
        `coef_` attribute that holds the fitted parameters. The first
        dimension of the `coef_` array must be equal to the number of features
        of the input dataset of the estimator. Important features must
        correspond to high absolute values in the `coef_` array.

        For instance, this is the case for most supervised learning
        algorithms such as Support Vector Classifiers and Generalized
        Linear Models from the `svm` and `linear_model` modules.

    n_features_to_select : int
        The number of features to select.

    step : int or float, optional (default=1)
        If greater than or equal to 1, then `step` corresponds to the (integer)
        number of features to remove at each iteration.
        If within (0.0, 1.0), then `step` corresponds to the percentage
        (rounded down) of features to remove at each iteration.

    Attributes
    ----------
    `n_features_` : int
        The number of selected features.

    `support_` : array of shape [n_features]
        The mask of selected features.

    `ranking_` : array of shape [n_features]
        The feature ranking, such that `ranking_[i]` corresponds to the ranking
        position of the i-th feature. Selected (i.e., estimated best) features
        are assigned rank 1.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example shows how to retrieve the 5 right informative
    features in the Friedman #1 dataset.

    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_friedman1
    >>> from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
    >>> from sklearn.svm import SVR
    >>> X, y = make_friedman1(n_samples=50, n_features=10, random_state=0)
    >>> estimator = SVR(kernel="linear")
    >>> selector = RFE(estimator, 5, step=1)
    >>> selector = selector.fit(X, y)
    >>> selector.support_ # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True,
            False, False, False, False, False], dtype=bool)
