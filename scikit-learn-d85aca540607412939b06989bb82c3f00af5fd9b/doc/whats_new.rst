API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when updgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.9:

  - Some estimators that may overwrite their inputs to save memory previously
    had ``overwrite_`` parameters; these have been replaced with ``copy_``
    parameters with exactly the opposite meaning.

    This particularly affects some of the estimators in ``linear_models``.
    The default behavior is still to copy everything passed in.

===

scikit-learn 0.9 was released on September 2011, three months after the 0.8
release and includes the new modules :ref:`manifold`, :ref:`dirichlet_process`
as well as several new algorithms and documentation improvements.

This release also includes the dictionary-learning work developed by
`Vlad Niculae`_ as part of the `Google Summer of Code
<http://code.google.com/soc/>`_ program.

API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when updgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.8:

  - The ``scikits.learn`` package was renamed ``sklearn``. There is
    still a ``scikits.learn`` package alias for backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bscikits.learn\b/sklearn/g'

  - Estimators no longer accept model parameters as ``fit`` arguments:
    instead all parameters must be only be passed as constructor
    arguments or using the now public ``set_params`` method inhereted
    from :class:`base.BaseEstimator`.

    Some estimators can still accept keyword arguments on the ``fit``
    but this is restricted to data-dependent values (e.g. a Gram matrix
    or an affinity matrix that are precomputed from the ``X`` data matrix.

  - The ``cross_val`` package has been renamed to ``cross_validation``
    although there is also a ``cross_val`` package alias in place for
    backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bcross_val\b/cross_validation/g'

  - The ``score_func`` argument of the
    ``sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score`` function is now expected
    to accept ``y_test`` and ``y_predicted`` as only arguments for
    classification and regression tasks or ``X_test`` for unsupervised
    estimators.

  - ``gamma`` parameter for support vector machine algorithms is set
    to ``1 / n_features`` by default, instead of ``1 / n_samples``.

  - The ``sklearn.hmm`` has been marked as orphaned: it will be removed
    from scikit-learn in version 0.11 unless someone steps up to
    contribute documentation, examples and fix lurking numerical
    stability issues.

  - ``sklearn.neighbors`` has been made into a submodule.  The two previously
    available estimators, ``NeighborsClassifier`` and ``NeighborsRegressor``
    have been marked as deprecated.  Their functionality has been divided
    among five new classes: ``NearestNeighbors`` for unsupervised neighbors
    searches, ``KNeighborsClassifier`` & ``RadiusNeighborsClassifier``
    for supervised classification problems, and ``KNeighborsRegressor``
    & ``RadiusNeighborsRegressor`` for supervised regression problems.

  - ``sklearn.ball_tree.BallTree`` has been moved to
    ``sklearn.neighbors.BallTree``.  Using the former will generate a warning.

  - ``sklearn.linear_model.LARS()`` and related classes (LassoLARS,
    LassoLARSCV, etc.) have been renamed to
    ``sklearn.linear_model.Lars()``.

  - All distance metrics and kernels in ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise`` now have a Y
    parameter, which by default is None. If not given, the result is the distance
    (or kernel similarity) between each sample in Y. If given, the result is the
    pairwise distance (or kernel similarity) between samples in X to Y.

  - ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise.l1_distance`` is now called ``manhattan_distance``,
    and by default returns the pairwise distance. For the component wise distance,
    set the parameter ``sum_over_features`` to ``False``.

Backward compatibilty package aliases and other deprecated classes and
functions will be removed in version 0.11.

.. _changes_0_6:

0.6
===

scikit-learn 0.6 was released on december 2010. It is marked by the
inclusion of several new modules and a general renaming of old
ones. It is also marked by the inclusion of new example, including
applications to real-world datasets.


Changelog
---------

  - New `stochastic gradient
    <http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/modules/sgd.html>`_ descent
    module by Peter Prettenhofer. The module comes with complete
    documentation and examples.

  - Improved svm module: memory consumption has been reduced by 50%,
    heuristic to automatically set class weights, possibility to
    assign weights to samples (see
    :ref:`example_svm_plot_weighted_samples.py` for an example).

  - New :ref:`gaussian_process` module by Vincent Dubourg. This module
    also has great documentation and some very neat examples. See
    :ref:`example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_regression.py` or
    :ref:`example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_probabilistic_classification_after_regression.py`
    for a taste of what can be done.

  - It is now possible to use liblinear’s Multi-class SVC (option
    multi_class in :class:`svm.LinearSVC`)

  - New features and performance improvements of text feature
    extraction.

  - Improved sparse matrix support, both in main classes
    (:class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV`) as in modules
    sklearn.svm.sparse and sklearn.linear_model.sparse.

  - Lots of cool new examples and a new section that uses real-world
    datasets was created. These include:
    :ref:`example_applications_plot_face_recognition.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_plot_species_distribution_modeling.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_svm_gui.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_wikipedia_principal_eigenvector.py` and
    others.

  - Faster :ref:`least_angle_regression` algorithm. It is now 2x
    faster than the R version on worst case and up to 10x times faster
    on some cases.

  - Faster coordinate descent algorithm. In particular, the full path
    version of lasso (:func:`linear_model.lasso_path`) is more than
    200x times faster than before.

  - It is now possible to get probability estimates from a
    :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` model.

  - module renaming: the glm module has been renamed to linear_model,
    the gmm module has been included into the more general mixture
    model and the sgd module has been included in linear_model.

  - Lots of bug fixes and documentation improvements.

Changelog
---------

New classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Support for sparse matrices in some classifiers of modules
      ``svm`` and ``linear_model`` (see :class:`svm.sparse.SVC`,

      linear_model module (:class:`linear_model.LassoCV`, :class:`linear_model.ElasticNetCV`,
      etc.).

    - New, more efficient LARS algorithm implementation. The Lasso
      variant of the algorithm is also implemented. See

      :class:`hmm.GMMHMM`)

    - New module feature_extraction (see :ref:`class reference
      <feature_extraction_ref>`)

    - New FastICA algorithm in module sklearn.fastica


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Improved documentation for many modules, now separating
      narrative documentation from the class reference. As an example,
      see `documentation for the SVM module
      <http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/modules/svm.html>`_ and the
      complete `class reference
      <http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/modules/classes.html>`_.

Fixes
~~~~~

    - API changes: adhere variable names to PEP-8, give more
      meaningful names.

    - Fixes for svm module to run on a shared memory context
      (multiprocessing).

    - It is again possible to generate latex (and thus PDF) from the
      sphinx docs.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

    - new examples using some of the mlcomp datasets:
      :ref:`example_mlcomp_sparse_document_classification.py`,
      :ref:`example_mlcomp_document_classification.py`

    - Many more examaples. `See here
      <http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/auto_examples/index.html>`_
      the full list of examples.


External dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Joblib is now a dependencie of this package, although it is
      shipped with (sklearn.externals.joblib).

Removed modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Module ann (Artificial Neural Networks) has been removed from
      the distribution. Users wanting this sort of algorithms should
      take a look into pybrain.

Misc
~~~~

    - New sphinx theme for the web page.
