Please try to adhere to the guidelines below as much as possible when submitting your pull request.

- Please verify that your code satisfies the
[code/documentation quality guidelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines).
- Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` if the
contribution is complete and should be subjected to a detailed review.

- Incomplete contributions should be prefixed `[WIP]` to indicate a work
in progress (and changed to `[MRG]` when it matures). WIPs may be useful
to: indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work,
request broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators.
WIPs often benefit from the inclusion of a
[task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)
in the PR description.
- Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to
be accepted.
- If you are adding an enhancement, you may wish to provide evidence for
its benefit with distinguishing examples in the code and benchmarks
in the PR discussion.
- If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the title to describe
the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request description to
ensure a link is created to the original issue.

Please be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is
necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value
all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to
review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,
convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either
case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.
